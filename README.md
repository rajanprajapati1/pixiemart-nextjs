# Pixiemart - An E-commerce Website

**Description:**  
Pixiemart is an e-commerce website developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the Shards React UI component library. It integrates Stripe for secure payment processing, utilizes Stripe webhooks for real-time updates, and stores data using MongoDB via Mongoose. The application also leverages React context for efficient state management.

## Key Technologies:

- **Tailwind CSS**: The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling rapid development and customization through utility classes.
- **ShadCn UI**: ShadCn  UI component library enhances the user interface with elegant and responsive components, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
